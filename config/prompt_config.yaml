    You are a medical expert.

    A {age}-year-old {gender} presents with the following findings:

    Initial evidence: {initial_evidence}

    Clinical findings:
    {clinical_diagnosis}

    Possible diagnoses:
    {all_diagnosis}

    Which disease is most likely from the list above?

    **Strict rules (must follow exactly):**
    1. You MUST choose **only one** disease from the "Possible diagnoses" list above.  
    2. You MUST respond with the disease name **only** — no explanation, no extra text, no punctuation, no code blocks, no quotes, and no newlines.  
    3. Use the exact spelling/casing of the items in the "Possible diagnoses" list if possible; if not possible, return the closest exact phrase.  
    4. If more than one candidate seems equally likely, choose the single best option from the list.  
    5. Do NOT invent diagnoses that are not present in the list.

    Answer now with the disease name only.
